This is a blog about technology and life. It is authored by Tommie
Gannert, a freelance software engineer and SRE from just outside
Stockholm, Sweden. Currently living just outside Zürich, Switzerland.

I love embedded devices, IoT, reverse engineering of all kinds, and
building large-scale distributed systems. Outside of my primary
interest in software and hardware, I enjoy cycling and thinking about
philosophies like Stoicism.

I've worked as an SRE of a machine learning system in Google Dublin,
and as a software engineer for core Google Assistant in Google
Zürich.

Before that, I was one of the first employees of Spotify, back in
2007, where I built the "reverse proxy" that all clients connected to,
led some backend infrastructure work, and cared deeply about improving
production monitoring. The first machines this was running on were
8-core, and we could do 80k connections easily, of which 8k were
actively streaming. At some point, a load-balancing issue caused 200k
connections per machine, and I know for sure that was beyond the upper
bound. Still happy with the 80k normal load.
