title: About This Site

This is a blog about technology and life. It is authored by Tommie
Gannert, a freelance software engineer and SRE from just outside
Stockholm, Sweden. Currently living just outside Zürich, Switzerland.

I love embedded devices, IoT, reverse engineering of all kinds, and
building large-scale distributed systems. Outside of my primary
interest in software and hardware, I enjoy cycling and thinking about
philosophies like Stoicism.

I've worked as an SRE of a machine learning system in Google Dublin,
and as a software engineer for core Google Assistant in Google
Zürich.

Before that, I was one of the first employees of Spotify, back in
2007, where I built the "reverse proxy" that all clients connected to,
led some backend infrastructure work, and cared deeply about improving
production monitoring. On December 31st, 2008, I caused all reverse
proxies to die instantly, because a leap second was inserted, and I
had an assertion that checked that time was monotonically
increasing. That's when I learned that, somehow,
[`CLOCK_MONOTONIC`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clock_getres.2.html)
isn't actually monotonic (but `CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW` is.) No one seems
to have noticed.
