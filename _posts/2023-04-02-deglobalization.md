[Work-from-home is the new normal in Canada](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35410886).
Whether that is true or not, I can't tell, but it made me realize that the deglobalization movement and the work-from-home movement are both instances of decentralization.

Perhaps Bitcoin wasn't the answer the world was looking for, but cryptocurrency is yet another area in the current decentralization trend.

Against this trend?
Banks consolidating.
