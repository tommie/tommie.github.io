I recently read my diary and found this from 2023.

Originally, I heard it [read by Sir Michael Caine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqOgyNfHl1U), but presenting it here for those who prefer reading.

## If, by Rudyard Kipling

> If you can keep your head when all about you
>    are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
> If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
>    but make allowance for their doubting too;
> If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
>    or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
> Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
>    and yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:
>
> If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
>    If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
> If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
>    and treat those two impostors just the same;
> If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
>    twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
> Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
>    and stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:
>
> If you can make one heap of all your winnings
>    and risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
> And lose, and start again at your beginnings
>    and never breathe a word about your loss;
> If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
>    to serve your turn long after they are gone,
> And so hold on when there is nothing in you
>    except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’
>
> If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
>    or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
> If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
>    If all men count with you, but none too much;
> If you can fill the unforgiving minute
>    with sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,
> Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,
>    and—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!

I wrote that it, for some reason, made me think of

> No foe can hurt you more than your closest friend
