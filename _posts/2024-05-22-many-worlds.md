title: Extending The Many-Worlds Interpretation To Consciousness
categories: [philosophy, life]
---

This is going to be a bit far out there, and I'm going to sound like a wacko...
It's not a topic I'm supposed to like to talk about in the society I live in.
It's labeled pseudo-scientific drivel, and is mocked for trying to sound scientific, while just being unprovable armchair philosophy.
Well, this is my blog, and if you're not into armchair philosophy, you should probably stop reading now.

Everything starts with a seed, a glimmer of an idea.
To me, this what-if post is just a seed.
Perhaps something useful can come out of it, even if it isn't a PhD dissertation.
And that probably makes me deserve the "wacko" epithet.
Hopefully, I have other traits that weigh up for it.

## Locally Exponential Branching

The [Many-worlds interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation) (MWI) of quantum mechanics suggests that all possible outcomes of quantum states happen.
As (internal) observers, we just happen to be on one of these paths through the ever splitting multiverse.
Notably, extending the [Anthropic principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle), there is some self-selection here, since branches of the multiverse that cannot sustain life will not have internal observers.
Let's do a little what-if exploration on that topic.
This post explores the experience of the universe if we assume that the MWI is right.

It must be noted that time branches are (truly) exponential, in this scenario.
At every point in time, the universe is divided with the same branching factor each time.
At least locally, over the lifespan of a human.
It's unlikely that all probabilities would start forming spikes in the combined wave function.
(It's possible that, looking at the full time span of the universe, the branching factor is non-constant, it doesn't matter to a human consciousness.)

My question now is: how would this affect a self-aware observer that moves through time?
Clearly, branches that are not life-sustainable will not be observed, as mentioned above.
But does this also apply to the individual?

## A Model Of Self-Awareness

To start, what does "me" flowing through time mean?
Looking at relativity, it has something to do with spatial location.
Being "here" is special, because there is a finite number of "theres" that could have come Here since the birth of the universe.
Also, there can't be more than a certain density of mass in one location, so not everyone can be Here at the same point in space time.

It's also useful to have senses; to be able to observe new things coming to my Here.
Otherwise, I couldn't tell Here apart from There.
If there is nothing special about where I am, then the "I" would have to encompass the entire universe (or none of it.)
And I'm pretty sure I feel like there's a me and lots of others, so that won't do as a model.
I have senses, and Here is distinct.

A second useful thing to have is memory.
What I consider to be myself has grown from two half-cells to a pretty complex organism.
This history is both physiological and mental.
Since we're (eventually) discussing consciousness, I'll ignore the physiological history.
The mental history, however, is probably crucial in feeling like myself.
Even if I observe most things my wife does (as we... live our lives closely together,) I have never once felt like I am her.
Thus, history matters, and mental history is called memory.
We don't have to go all the way to recollectable memories, just that neurological adaptations that have happened since birth makes my consciousness non-fungible.

And finally, we need something that ties memory together with senses.
We could call this consciousness, rationality, or ability to reason.
It is something that can form new neurological adaptations in the time to come.
Without the ability to remember, it seems difficult to be self-aware, but I can't really put words on that notion.
Anyway, if you have memories (above,) and started from two half-cells without memories, it follows that you have had this ability to form new memories.

## Area Under the Curve

Let's draw the most obvious conclusion first:
If forming memories stops when my life stops, it would seem that multiverse branches that lead to the end would be special somehow.
Thinking about the quantum Me, without the time aspect, there would be a lower probability that I experience myself existing in branches that lead to the end earlier.
So (yeah, let's do this)... if we integrate self-awareness over time, and take it as a probability of living to observe it, I'm biased to observing a long life?
Sure, when there are more paths leading to the end than are viable, this might be skewed, but given how good biological organisms are at repairing themselves, my guess is this only happens rather late.
And that brings me to my main point.

If the MWI is correct, then my life's length should be a statistical outlier to the upside.
Since time branches are exponential, all the paths that lead to an early end will be negligible in size compared to those where I survive.
I cannot experience the ends, so I'm left with experiencing the survivals.
And, if we again look outside the time domain, it's even unlikely I'd experience the near-ends, as they are so small.

Before I continue, let me just clarify that "I" here does not mean Me-The-Author, but each and every self-aware consciousness.
Everyone will experience this, on their own path through the multiverse.
So, from now on, let's talk about you instead.

By the way, that also means this cannot be usefully proven, since everyone is just a statistical anomaly on their own path; the average human lifespan remains the same across space.
Other consciousnesses will observe you on any of the paths, perhaps ending you earlier than what people expected.
Your existence (usually) doesn't matter to their ability to experience themselves.
(Some existences could be linked, in situations that are likely to lead to either all or none surviving.)
We would have to look at experienced age across branches, and doing that is probably much harder than to prove that the MWI is a good model...
Not going to happen.

## Unexpected Survival

Thus, from your perspective, your life would seem like a constant stream of near misses and unusually good luck in terms of survival.
Note that "luck" here is not about winning the lottery.
Your life might be taking positive or negative turns; that doesn't matter to the ability to experience life.
But you will survive.
That train crash where you were the only survivor?
That crazy risk you took, where everything went wrong, and somehow you still came out of it?
Just the nature of being in an (assumed) MWI multiverse.

Going back to the lottery, this has some implications on your well-being...
If you're constantly a survivor, it stands to reason that some of these events leave scars.
Both physical and mental.
You didn't expect to walk away from the train crash unharmed, did you?
All I said was that it didn't kill you.

These near-miss experiences are likely to leave you mindful of your existence.
You'll either be grateful, or spiteful, depending on what has happened in it.
How that expresses itself depends on who you are.

## Closing Words

These thoughts have been nagging me for a few months.
Since there is absolutely nothing I can do with them, I'll just share them and hope I can move on.

It seems to me that MWI would lead to misery.
(Perhaps that's the origin of purgatory.)
On the upside, you'd also have good stories to tell.
On the practical side, you should take care of yourself, should the universe want you around as a statistical anomaly.

Oh, and if the multiverse does have exponential branching, you should write your blog posts as early as possible.
To maximize the impact it will have on the future.
