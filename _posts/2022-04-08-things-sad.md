Sometimes, I'm overwhelmed by how much crap is going on:

* Technologically advanced humans not living sustainably. That
  "undiscovered" tribe in the Amazonas were pretty cool: live to talk
  and tattoo. Once every fortnight you walk to The Tree a few miles
  away and cut off some sugary roots. Boring, perhaps, but
  sustainable.
* We've only been splitting atoms for 100 years. It's very likely we
  haven't seen the worst accident or nuclear war yet. Hopefully it
  doesn't happen in my lifetime.
* As we increase our nuclear power use, we have to improve mean time
  betwen failure (MTBF). With more plants and no improvements to MTBF,
  we're adding risk. How do you measure MTBF when systems are never
  allowed to fail, because it's too devastating if they do?
* The developed world expects the emerging world to be as okay with
  not using oil as themselves. It's easy to say "solar" when you've
  had a 100 year headstart on cheap energy use. Provide some carrots,
  you countries who can.
* There's not enough accountability in mining. If you put stuff into
  circulation, you should be responsible for eventually taking it out
  of circulation. Since we can't trust you to be around, you should be
  paying insurance fees. Since we don't know how much will be needed,
  they should be high.
* Mars colonization sounds like a cool goal. How much energy are we
  going to spend developing that? Is it actually nice living on Mars?
  Isn't it nicer to make Earth continually inhabitable?
* I want to go on a cruise, but I really don't want to support this
  energy waste. Global tourism was probably a really bad idea. And
  yet, lots of economies are going to die as we wind it down.
* Population stabilization or decline is probably needed if we want to
  maintain quality of life while stopping cheap energy use. Sadly,
  many economies are built on ever increasing GDP.

You know, nature doesn't care if ecosystems live or die. Earth will
continue to exist. It doesn't care if there are a few million years of
high temperatures before an ice age and a new stage of evolution sets
in. It doesn't even care about mutual assured destruction. There's
really nothing obvious about caring about climate change. The
meteorite that killed the dinosaurs probably didn't feel bad about its
actions. The errupting volcano that covered the sky with soot probably
didn't worry about the effects. The curse is that we humans can
measure and reason, and feel bad about our (in)actions. And not just
our own, but actions from previous generations.

Yeah, I can rationalize my actions either way. Eventually, it will be
absorbed by the sun anyway. What does it really mean to live life the
best way I can?
