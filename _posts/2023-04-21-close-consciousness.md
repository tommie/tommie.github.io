Having read
[Consciousness begins with feeling, not thinking](https://iai.tv/articles/consciousness-begins-with-feelings-hanna-damasio-auid-2462)
via [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35652513), I
wondered...

1. To have *feelings*, do you require external input? That is, could a
   closed system have feelings? If not, then it cannot be conscious,
   if we follow the post.
2. What is *external input*? Is it simply a signal you cannot predict?
   If non-predictability is the key, that suggests the actual signal
   is the error between prediction and reality, because the only way
   of knowing that something was unpredictable is to compare the
   prediction and the stimulus.
3. So one definition of what constitutes a *closed system* in regards
   to an isolated unit of consciousness, could be that it somehow
   relates to its own predictive power of emergent behavior from the
   parts of itself?
   * The "emergent behavior" needs to be a part of this, since parts
     generally exhibit variance that doesn't show on a macro
     level. Violence in Swiss society doesn't have a large enough
     impact on the emergent behavior of society as a whole, so its
     unpredictability doesn't matter to the societal organism.
