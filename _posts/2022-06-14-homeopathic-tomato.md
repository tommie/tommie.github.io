title: Homeopathic Tomato in Cooking
categories: [cooking, hyperbole]

Homeopathy is surprisingly prevalent in Switzerland. I don't know how
many people actually buy at the stores, but the stores are quite
common.

I've found one good use of homeopathy: cooking. Tomatoes are my
forbidden fruit in the kitchen. I like how they change the flavor of
food when cooked, but I shouldn't try them raw, or I'll regret
it. There's something about the acidity in raw tomatoes that just
doesn't work for me. Cherry tomatoes are okay, but I'd rather leave
them when I find them in a salad.

The answer to this is normally to cook the tomatoes until the acidity
vanishes. I have no issues with ketchup, chili con carne and other
prepared dishes, but it turns out that the best way for me to enjoy
tomato sauce is "very little." I make my dish, and at the end I just
put a splash of passed tomatoes on it. Cannelloni? Don't douse it;
just dash some before putting it in the oven.

But, you say, if this is about homeopathic tomato use, wouldn't *no
tomato* be better than a *dash*? Well, you have to apply homeopathy to
homeopathy itself: the less homeopathic principles you use, the more
powerful it is.
