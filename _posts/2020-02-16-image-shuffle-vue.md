Inspired by my wife playing this game, I thought it would be an
interesting challenge to use drag-n-drop, and using CSS to split up an
image into multiple tiles.

The code is listed below.

{% include 2020-02-16-image-shuffle-vue.html %}

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/2020-02-16-image-shuffle-vue.css">
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2.6.11"></script>
<script src="/assets/2020-02-16-image-shuffle-vue.js"></script>

## HTML document

```html
{% include 2020-02-16-image-shuffle-vue.html %}
```

## Javascript program

```javascript
{% include 2020-02-16-image-shuffle-vue.js %}
```

## CSS stylesheet
```css
{% include 2020-02-16-image-shuffle-vue.css %}
```
