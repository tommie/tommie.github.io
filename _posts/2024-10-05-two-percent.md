title: Inflation At 2%
ctegories: [economics, mathematics]
---

With a target inflation of 2%, a doubling of prices takes 35 years.
Someone living to age 80 (say 60 years of price observations,) will see +228%.

"Prices are high these days" will always be the case.
Especially if the target is 2%, and governments fear deflation like the plague.
We'll see the occasional spurt, as we just did in 2021-2023.
But even without those times, inflation will be felt.

I'm now in my fourties and never expected it to feel this tangible.
Why does a pizza in Sweden cost over 100 kr now, and everyone seems to think it's normal?
Of course old people will be grumpy if this is what the economy/life feels like.

In Switzerland, everything is expensive, as always.
It doesn't help that Switzerland's national government just raised VAT by 5%, and wants to do it again to finance pensions.
