# Engineering Tools

A collection of standalone calculators and utilities for common engineering problems. Each tool is self-contained HTML that runs entirely in the browser - no server required.

## Mechanical Engineering

### [Helical Compression Spring Calculator](/tools/helical-spring)

Calculate spring constants and compression forces from material properties and physical dimensions. Solves the problem of AliExpress spring listings that show wire diameter, coil count, and material but not the actual spring performance you need for mechanical design.

## Home Automation & IoT

### [Matter QR Code Decoder](/tools/matter-qr-decoder)

Decode Matter/Thread QR codes to extract commissioning information including vendor ID, product ID, discriminator, and passcode. Supports camera scanning for QR codes and includes vendor name lookup for easier device identification.
